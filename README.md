:game_die: Dice is an experimental load balancer designed for non-microservice, static infrastructures with focus on simplicity and flexibility.

**Project status:** In active development.

## <img src="https://sternentstehung.de/dice-dot.png"> Included Features


* Different load balancing methods for each application
* Periodic health checks for deployed instances
* Service and server updates without downtime
* Configuration changes without restart
* Nodes with less computing resources receive less requests
* Attachment and detachment of instances on the fly
* Deployments managed by logical and physical affiliation
* Dice is passive and explicit: Make services available for load balancing yourself

### The Scenario

Our infrastructure is quite simple: We've got two servers, _main-server_ and _another-server_. Servers, virtual machines etc. are known to Dice as _nodes_. Also, we have the services _A_, _B_ and _C_. These services might be web applications, REST APIs or authentication services for example.

</p>

Each service _A_, _B_ and _C_ has an instance deployed to _main-server_. An instance is a concrete executable instance of a service, like a PHP application running on Apache or a standalone Go binary. Additionally, there are instances of _A_ and _B_ deployed to _another-server_ because they're under heavy load.

### Setting up our environment

To keep things short, we'll just create one node, one service and one instance. After starting Dice, we can register our _main-server_:

````shell script
$ dice node create --attach --weight=2 main-server
````

Registering nodes will help Dice choosing an appropriate service instance later. `--weight=2` indicates that the server has double computing capacities.

After that, we have to tell Dice about our services â€“ let's just create service _A_ here.

````shell script
$ dice service create --urls=example.com --enable A
````

By using `--url=example.com`, we specify a public URL that the service is associated with. We can add or remove these URLs later as well. When a request for `example.com` hits Dice, it will forward the request to an instance of service _A_.

### Start load balancing

Registering a service instance is fairly easy:

````shell script
$ dice instance create --name=first-instance A main-server 172.21.21.1:8080
````

This tells Dice to register an instance of service `A` that has been deployed to `main-server` and is available at `172.21.21.1:8080`.

Attaching the created instance to Dice will make it available for load balancing:

````shell script
$ dice instance attach first-instance
````

Incoming requests for `example.com` will be balanced among instances of _A_. In this case, `first-instance` will be used each time.
